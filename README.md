# WebMart
Amazon Clone is a simplified version of the Amazon shopping platform, designed to replicate the core shopping experience. Built using HTML and CSS, this project focuses on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for browsing products and categories. While currently a front-end only project, it showcases my ability to design and implement responsive web pages that mimic the look and feel of the Amazon website. This clone is part of my ongoing learning journey in web development, aimed at honing my skills in UI design and responsive layout techniques.
